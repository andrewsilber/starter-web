Andrew:
sure well no magic bullets there

Rob :
No but they are quite definite that if you try to do just cardio or just strength training, or not enough of both, you'll be treading water

Rob :
That matches my own experience

Rob :
And I can easily do this

Rob :
You know

Rob :
While I'm doing Corona, maybe I'll do a workout at lunch

Rob :
I like to shower in the morning to wake myself up but I could do it later in the day after I'm good and sweaty

Andrew:
If a tree stinks in the forest...

Rob :
Oh I'm drenched after these workouts.  I'm not gonna sit around and slime everything up
